# odin-landing-page
A landing page originally based on The Odin Project's guidelines to practice vanilla HTML &amp; CSS flexbox.

I learned how to create a landing page from start to finish without much handholding. Additional learnings included making rounded borders with `border-radius` and different background properties like `background-image: url(...)`, `background-position`, `background-size: cover`, and how to style buttons.

I should take note to include `box-sizing: border-box`, `padding: 0px`, and `margin: 0px` to all elements in order to have more control during initial site skeleton code layouting.
